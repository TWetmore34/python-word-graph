Dear Mr. Bossman,

While your offer to write the annual report was very appreciated, I have some minor concerns about my role in the project. It would be more effective to hire a dedicated technical communicator to write the report for several reasons. 
Firstly, a technical communicator brings essential considerations to the writing process. Stakeholder analysis, surveys, and editing styles specific to technical communicators are all vital to creating effective documentation. While I am familiar with the process on these, a professional technical communicator can accomplish them and adjust the document's writing accordingly. 
Particularly, the editing process of a technical communicator values simplicity in its design. A more concise document will be more effective for our audience, as many are distantly familiar with the work of our department. The combination of an outsider’s input and someone to edit the report for brevity will help readers better understand why our department's work is so crucial for the company.
The need for technical communicators to assist us cannot be understated. They provide the outlook and skillset needed to guarantee a top-tier document for the annual report. I implore you to consider hiring someone for this work and hope you factor in my recommendation.

Best,
TJ

Re:
Company Newsletter
	Dear Senior Employee,

I’ve just finished looking at the consumer newsletter you sent me for edits, and there are some significant changes I’d recommend past just mechanics changes. While the letter shows a wealth of expertise in your subject area, it is written with complex language that most consumers may be unfamiliar with. It may be worth considering writing to an outsider audience to make the content easier for general audiences.
In this case, writing for a general audience will create a more effective newsletter, as it allows the document to reach a wider audience and makes the read more accessible. Doing so will improve our chances of consumer retention. An informed consumer who chooses to work with us will create mutual trust because they better understand our work. 
There are simple fixes that may assist in writing for a general audience. For example, defining industry-specific terms allows you to guarantee that any reader fully understands your meaning, whether they are familiar with the term or not. It also allows you to be more specific in your explications of how the language is used, as you control the definition within the letter's context.
Thank you for considering my notes in this case. I am more than happy to continue assisting in the editing process should you need it, so feel free to reach out.
Best Wishes,
TJ Wetmore
