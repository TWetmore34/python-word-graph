0.0 Introduction
Within Chaucer’s writing, Treatise on the Astrolabe is one of the more innocuous pieces. Often skipped even by ardent readers of his work, it has been mainly considered an important piece of history regarding technical writing and audience, but little else. The response from readers speaks very little to its significance as more than just a piece of technical writing, as it becomes a vital relic to observe how Chaucer saw a blossoming sense of English identity. In this case, English identity refers to the sense of common heritage felt by those who considered themselves English. That sense has the potential to originate in a multitude of different locations, and Chaucer would likely have felt those connections from origins personal to himself. Chaucer saw himself as taking on a noble goal by expanding scientific information in the language while paying homage to the other cultures that developed the information. Because of English’s presence as a distinctly political language, Chaucer’s scientific work compares well to his more religious works and shows how he created a series of works to further the politics of hierarchy reinforced all over the English language (5). His paternalistic status makes him into an incredibly influential figure in the development of national identity that is defined by those politics and science writing becomes an excellent place to observe those patterns before comparing them to literature found in The Canterbury Tales. The comparison between Chaucer’s scientific and religious works is a relatively unexplored line of analysis, making it important to further Chaucer studies through aligning several seemingly unrelated theories on his writings.  In following the development of the scientific and religious documents of Chaucer’s, we can watch the evolution of the language’s politics as an essential outlook on English culture. Chaucer is just as much a way of tracking those changes as he is a source of them. 
0.1 Lit Review
Of the many discussions of Chaucer over the last 500 years, many scholars have tackled Chaucer’s use of English. Chaucer’s English has been attributed to plenty of different ideas on the formation of the language (Butterfield, Astell). However, some of the most important work has been on the effects of language on national identity. While opinions differ on what Chaucer’s choice of language accomplished, most scholars fall into two major divisions. Scholars like Ardis Butterfield use sources across the scope of the Middle Ages to argue that Chaucer was not intentionally forming an English identity. As Butterfield states, “rather than question [Chaucer’s] Englishness, the tide has turned even further toward an interest in the rise of English vernacularity and to new ways of explaining its ‘colossal rise…as a language’ (8).”  
Others, such as Guenée, would say that language was the primary marker for a nation at the time, citing medieval philosophers like Isidore of Seville (52). Additionally, Butterfield’s work situates itself on exploring the complicated relationship the Middle Ages had to language due to non-standardized forms, mixing of language, and the interactions of the former two with wars. Guenée’s argument suggests the connection between a nation and a language, but that does not leave them entirely removed from the considerations of the first group of scholars. Butterfield and Guenée both use language as a point of observation between these different cultures in order to examine their effects on one another. Guenée’s work takes a broad historical view of Europe as a whole. Still, the fundamental importance of language to the formation of culture is explored thoroughly by both he and Butterfield. 
English in Chaucer’s life was still in the process of developing, so it's not impossible to argue that Chaucer considered himself a pioneer for the language. The information available in the English language was a massive marker of that development for Chaucer, as much of the written works of the time would have been in Latin. This is made apparent through the rise of protestant movements such as the Wycliffite movement that focused on bringing more availability to English religious materials. The popularity of these movements speaks to something much like Chaucer himself did in technical writing. In this case, the pioneer ideology was not one Chaucer was alone in.
We can find evidence for the pioneer perspective he may have had in Treatise on the Astrolabe when he suggests a connection between the learnings of several different languages, concluding with “whiche Latyn folk had hem first out of othere dyverse langages” and “right as diverse pathes leden diverse folk the righte way to Rome,” thereby forging the said connection between English, Latin, and scientific knowledge (Chaucer, 21). By writing the piece in English, Chaucer reveals some of his relationship to English identity as one built on expanding available knowledge in English, as well as keeping its audience specific. But to understand that identity, it’s still important to take time and consider a few significant aspects. The first is the genre of science writing, which J.D covers. North in Chaucer’s Universe. North’s book is separated into two major parts; Firstly, he explains in detail how Chaucer’s astrolabe worked and estimates Chaucer’s understanding of contemporary cosmology. Secondly, North applies his estimates on Chaucer’s cosmology to the Canterbury Tales. Understanding science the same way Chaucer did is the first step to understanding what he wanted to represent with his work in both technical and fiction writing. By examining his content, we come to know some of the ideals he represented, such as Pseudo-Dionysian cosmology, and what he sought to accomplish by providing that knowledge to readers. Another essential aspect is Chaucer’s intended audience. While the content present in the texts is vital, it is equally important to know for whom these things were written. With those two in conjunction, we can get a firm idea of what parts of English society Chaucer supported or undermined with his work. 
While scholars debate as to whom the Treatise of the Astrolabe was written, it is generally agreed upon that Chaucer’s introduction, written to his son Lewis, was not only intended for his son. Some scholars, such as Ann Astel, argue that Chaucer wrote for a scholarly audience rather than a royal one in Chaucer and the Universe of Learning (3). As a result, she suggests a change in the historical studies of Chaucer by outlining his work in relation to clerks. Her work is written regarding the Canterbury Tales and Chaucer’s other fictional works, so applying it to Chaucer’s science writing can change the understanding of that audience. Chaucer’s audience could continue to appear as a scholarly class when examining the Treatise on the astrolabe; however, its status as a piece of accessible technical documentation challenges this notion. Instead, other scholars have worked with a more specific audience analysis of the Treatise on the Astrolabe, connecting its audience to the Canterbury Tales as well. One such scholar was Edgar Laird, who focused his argument on a straightforward premise- Chaucer’s audience was his friends, while he considered a wider, secondary, audience. These friends may have included a mix of scholarly and royal people in English society, but Laird argues the crowd would skew more towards the royal perspective instead. This brings us back to the point of distinction between scholars in Chaucer’s potential audience, either the courts or the scholars, and suggests that each had their role in his writing. It is also possible that Chaucer's audience was very simply an English one. This suggestion holds firm, as we see the Canterbury Tales and Treatise on the Astrolabe reach a wide range of identities through their texts, all of which were intended to explore different aspects of English society and life. The use of an English audience is also found in Chaucer’s Treatise and is set up as a moral imperative by Chaucer’s comparison to the knowledge of past empires. In suggesting he is the one to expand this knowledge, Chaucer opens himself to using both science and literature to explore the ideas these sciences bring and even fold in the ideas he himself holds into English identity.
2.0 Science and Religion in the Middle Ages
New historicists often talk about literature through the lens of non-literature-based writing. This can include tax codes, historical documents, and many other forms of communication to piece together seemingly unrelated documents into a consistent story. This style of analysis works so well because it assumes each piece of writing both is affected by and affects the culture around it. The same can be said about Chaucer’s use of scientific writing. By taking analysis done on Chaucer’s Treatise of the Astrolabe and connecting it to his work in The Canterbury Tales, we find new insight into Chaucer’s understanding of the English language and its connections to England as a nation through his consistent use of cosmological theories on hierarchy and power.
Conceptions of the relationship between science and religion in the Middle Ages generally suggest the two are separate from one another. One is seemingly based on fact, the other on faith, but that distinction was not entirely true during the period. Much of what linked the two was explained by Hannam as Christian theology’s desire to “study… the natural world, which was believed to be God’s creation (xviii).” Furthermore, this link can be observed by the raw amount of scientific study being done by the clergy because they functioned as the largest educated class in the estate system. It’s important to explicate the connection between religion and science because it implies two crucial pieces of information for understanding Chaucer and his link to nationalism in the English identity. The first is Chaucer’s choice to write in English. The use of English for writing was still uncommon during Chaucer’s life, especially for religious and scientific writing, so his choice to do so anyways shows a very intentional understanding of whom he wanted to read his work. The importance of Chaucer’s decision is also reflected in the paternalistic identity given to ‘Father Chaucer.’ The second is Chaucer’s area of study and the religious connections between the science of Cosmology. The role those religious aspects played in the foundations of English culture presents us with a point of observation between these two genres.
2.1 Chaucer’s audience
The audience for a given work is always an important factor when creating. As such, Chaucer scholars often focus on who Chaucer may have been writing for and why. In the case of Chaucer’s Treatise on the Astrolabe, the answer is deceptively simple. So simple, in fact, that he outright tells us to whom it is written: “wol I shewe the under full light reules and naked wordes in Englissh, for Latyn ne canst thou yit but small, my litel sone (21).” Here, Chaucer’s mention of his son’s lack of Latin becomes the focal point of the decision to write in English. However, Chaucer’s writing seems to consider more than an audience of children as outlined by Edgard Larid (1). Laird argues that Chaucer’s audience extends into a similar group to that of his poetry, with friends from the royal courts being the primary consideration. His argument hinges on Chaucer’s formal tone while referring to his son due to the expectation one would have a more lighthearted tone when speaking with a relative. This analysis is extremely useful for understanding Chaucer’s wider purpose in writing his Treatise because, as we will come to see, Chaucer’s sense of identity is rooted in both language and nation, both of which are factors of his audience. 
Laird’s theory is not the only one focused on exploring for whom Chaucer wrote. Ann Astel suggests that his audience was two-fold with royalty on one side and, more important to Astel, the clergy on another (4). With the wealth of religious themes present in The Canterbury Tales and Treatise on the Astrolabe, it would come as no surprise to find the clergy are an important part of the audience. While both Astel and Laird focus on two different potential audiences, there is one linking piece between the two— Chaucer’s use of English. This means that while both scholars are correct in their audience analysis, there is also an important secondary audience to keep in mind. Those who speak English are spoken to in Treatise when Chaucer speaks about the importance of writing so that anyone can understand (21). This use of a universal audience is a conscious decision to bring the information present to as wide an audience as possible among those who speak the language.
Chaucer mentions this decision in the introduction to his Treatise through the hope that his Treatise will be “as trewe but as many and as subtile conclusiouns, as ben shewid in Latyn in eny commune tretys of the Astrelabie,” showing that he desires to see his work as comparable to that of the Latin written counterparts, which would have been written by clergy members (21). Importantly, Chaucer does view his work in this case as that of a translator, rather than a creator. Chaucer’s self-image as a translator is proceeded by a call to several different language/country pairings that suggest where he is pulling the information from, as well as the legacy he sees himself building upon. Despite his call to avoid the label of astrologer, we find he does create an image of English as a useful tool to describe the sciences, and in doing so he creates a lasting cultural piece of science writing. 
Some may also suggest the potential of more practical reasons for English. Rather than Chaucer’s intent being a moral one, wherein he creates a new wealth of information for the language of his home country, it is instead just for ease of access. Those around him would have spoken English and even the Treatise says it's written in English for the sake of his son’s lack of Latin. While this conception may not be entirely untrue, as English did bring Chaucer’s writing to some of his desired audience, it is certainly not all that we see from him on the matter. In the introduction to the Treatise, Chaucer lays out a series of previous nations, all of which had to go through compiling the same information he was preparing to present (21). At that moment, he implies that the work he is doing is for the sake of both a nation and a language, not just a child’s wish to learn astronomy. 
2.2	Exploring Religion through science
If considerations of Chaucer’s audience are important, considerations of what he wanted that audience to gain by reading his work are equally important. By understanding the goals of his presented work, we can gain more insight to what he believed his audience may have stood to learn through his writing. The work presented in Treatise on the Astrolabe is scientific in nature, so we know that his goal would have been imparting knowledge in the fields of cosmology and astrology to his reader, but there are further connections to what the fields were used for when it comes to wider societal structures. 
One such structure is religion— Pseudo-Dionysian cosmology, which focused on “angelic hierarchies” and suggested that the ruling structures of earth should mirror those hierarchies (North, 21). North briefly explains the connection between Chaucer and the Neo-Platonists that first outlined the Pseudo-Dionysian study. However, because of its prominence in The Canterbury Tales, I believe the connection is worth exploring in further detail. The Pseudo-Dionysian figures used by Chaucer often take the form of Greek or Roman legends as we see him tie England to the empires of old. Specifically, The Knight’s Tale makes for a great example of Godly authority found in a king. Theseus stands as an intimidating figure with the rights of life and death in his hands. We see Palamon reference him as “a rightful lord and juge” when Palamon requested that Theseus kill both he and Arcite (Line 1719). In the same scene, Theseus exclaims “ye shall be deed by mighty Mars the reed” to give the reader a sense of that heavenly hierarchy (1747). Some may mention Palamon and Arcite’s standing as knights within the context of the story, but in this case, it is their standing relative to Theseus that makes all the difference. Gods stand above kings, stand above the average people who find themselves often caught between the struggles of those above their standing. 
Chaucer’s use of the Pseudo-Dionysian does not exclusively exist in his literature, as we find it in Treatise as well. His use of the cosmology takes the form of a language/nation pairing when he writes “preie God save the king, that is lord of this langage and all that him feith berith and obeieth (21),” Chaucer’s uses the word ‘feith’ to claim that those who support the king are exerting a kind of faith in a king and God (MED, ‘feith’). This addresses two important qualities of the work through audience and content. The audience for Chaucer’s work was both religious and royal, so in terms of audience, the use of religious validation for secular rulers reinforces the status of each. This is accomplished through Chaucer’s content. The use of Pseudo-Dionysian ideals to show royalty as a reflection of Godly authority makes an image to support the target audience for Chaucer’s work on both fronts, and the use of a secondary English audience brings those ideals to an audience that recognizes itself as a language and now understands a similar hierarchy to the ones used by Chaucer throughout his work.
Others may claim that language and nationality are not so closely linked. After all, there were those who spoke French within England’s borders; Chaucer himself even spoke more than English. The blending of these national lines makes for a complicated picture of nationality, and scholars have looked to explore those complexities. For example, some claim “England’s “trilingual” status makes the history of defining nations from language more complicated (Butterfield, 11). While the importance of this trilingual status is an excellent point of observation, it also leads to the necessity of exploration as to why Chaucer would choose English out of those three—exploring why he wrote for a particular sect of England’s population forces one to contend with Chaucer’s choice of language. This use of language as a point of examination requires defining what a nation is, for which I will look to Guenée, who suggested nations were defined by language (53). This definition of nationality is consistent with Chaucer's writing and brings up further questions about his use of other languages throughout The Canterbury Tales.
Overall, science writing played an important role in religious sectors in England. In outlining the intent Chaucer may have had between his science and religious writing, we can find further insights into Chaucer’s understanding of hierarchy in England. The opportunity to see Chaucer’s use of this hierarchy on a wider scale remains and can be found using other texts. To better define the English nationality, Chaucer would likely have needed to define what it was not as well, which is where the issue of nationalism arises.
3.0 Nationalism
English has been viewed as a language that emerged with some distinct political goals. Machan describes English as a “language that both embodies a resistant English community and articulates that community’s radical orientation towards orthodox social and religious authority,” which gives some sense of what those politics may have looked like (5). One such source of those politics was the Wycliffite movement, which Chaucer has been repeatedly connected with over the years by scholars such as Strohm and even Machan himself. These movements were intended to focus on who had a primary hold on the people of England in the 14th century and forward and would lead to a later protestant wave through the country. It is important to consider the other ramifications that came alongside these changes, as we see with the rise of national identity comes nationalism, which presents itself a multitude of times in Chaucer’s work in large part because of the emphasis he placed on the English being Christian and English-speaking people.
Chaucer’s attitudes through The Canterbury Tales often shift dramatically from tale to tale. He has a habit of suggesting two extremes for each role he writes about to avoid being seen as biased or overtly antagonistic. For example, with every king or royal that is the butt of a joke, there is another that exemplifies everything a king should be. This can make examinations of his tales for intent quite tricky and time-consuming. Deciding which of those perspectives were satirical or otherwise is complicated and often requires an abundance of other material on the life Chaucer led in search for clues. Thankfully, not all of Chaucer’s work was satirical. When used in conjunction with Chaucer’s satire in works such as the Man of Law’s Tale, Treatise can help us piece together a picture to look at the potential politics behind his tales and how those affected the audiences explored prior to this. 
3.1 Man of Law’s tale
	The Man of Law’s Tale is a story of Christian patience. While, at first glance, it may seem such a story would have little to do with Chaucer’s reasons for writing a technical document, there is evidence to suggest not just the presence of astrology in the text but also its application. The use of astronomy in the tale indicates more of Chaucer’s own intent in offering his Treatise, allowing us to understand how Chaucer would have seen the content of science writing as applicable to literature. This link serves us well once we have some knowledge of his audience alongside content. In knowing whom he would want to be educated about astrological presence in the tale, we find evidence of the more philosophical applications of the science in Chaucer’s Treatise.
	Setting plays a crucial role in the Man of Law’s Tale. The reader is pulled around from place to place, following a passive protagonist in Custance, only to find themselves moving from Rome to sea, to England, to Rome again. When analyzing the tale, it is important to question why Chaucer may have chosen to use Rome as his central location rather than England as he did for many of the other tales. Thankfully, Treatise on the Astrolabe can provide some answers as to why the setting was chosen, as well as provide further explication to why Custance brings the change she does to a pagan England.
A potential answer to this question can be found in Chaucer’s own writing on the astrolabe. As we saw in section 2.1, Chaucer uses a series of language/nation pairings to build up his own use of English as a moral imperative. He saw the translation of the information in his Treatise as crucial to English as a language and a nation. At the end of the statement, Chaucer adds two crucial details. Firstly, the line “Latyn folk had hem first out of othere dyverse langages” tells us Chaucer saw Rome as the place of origin for the information present (21). Secondly, Chaucer finishes his sentiment by suggesting all languages and nations need this information, much as all roads lead to Rome (21). The two sentiments used by Chaucer, in this case, imply a link between the pagan England and Rome portrayed in the Man of Law’s Tale for its science and religion. 
Science, specifically astrology, is referenced directly in the Man of Law’s Tale when the man of law asks, “was ther no philosophre in al thy toun?” in reference to the Roman emperor. In this case, the MED refers to ‘philosophre’ as a “magician” or “diviner (MED, ‘philosophre’).” While not one to one, it is safe to assume that the route taken for this divination was astrology, as it was considered “the most widespread and respected of the magical disciplines” and was directly connected to the art of divination (Hannam, 115). The history of divination and religion is a complicated one. Still, the end result of their turbulent relationship was the church incorporating it and other forms of magic into their own practices. Interestingly, that relationship is visible in the Man of Law’s Tale, when Chaucer lists the stars as a written form of God’s will: “For in the sterres, clerer than is glas//Is writen, God woot, whoso koude it rede//The death of every man, without doubt (lines 195-7).” This furthers the historical examples found in Hannam’s work, allowing us to see both a broad historical understanding of astrology along with Chaucer’s own ideas on the subject. This also places a connection between “the divine stability” Chaucer was so fond of (North, 11). The stars become a means of reading fate alongside the mutability of humans. Chaucer then goes further, representing that same relationship between the stars as a relationship between the people in the narrative and the heavens. 
Outside of the setting in Man of Law’s Tale, we also find important information in the presence of several royal figures in the narrative. An important aspect of nationalism is whom it pushes a people to support, so royalty becomes an essential point of observation. Of the royal figures we see, there are two major conversions. First is the sultan who first marries Custance, then King Alla. Both convert from Islam to Christianity, but one is killed in a heavenly twist of fate that Chaucer refers to by saying, “that crueel Mars hath slayn this mariage” (lines 301). Mars, in this case, refers to both the god and planet as one word, as shown by Chaucer’s further descriptions of Mars as the dominant house in the marriage. This use of Mars as a religious and astrological figure directly connects to the Pseudo-Dionysian cosmology discussed earlier. Going further, it's worth observing how the story could very well have continued forward from the first pagan land, but instead, Custance washed up on the English shore and began converting people there. The choice to send Custance to England through the work of the gods gives more evidence to considerations of national fervor through the use of religion that becomes especially visible when looking for Chaucer’s use of the Pseudo-Dionysian. 
Focusing on the second of the two rulers Custance marries, king Alla is another example of a royal figure given power over life and death. As a ruler in what would become England, he becomes a fascinating way of portraying the religious qualifications of being English as well. Despite being a king in England, he isn’t referred to as an English king. Instead, he was the king of a pagan land until he converted. This creates an image where religion plays an important role in English identity alongside language. The things that distinguish this pagan England and the one contemporary readers would have known are emphasized in this royal figurehead, then made a little more familiar after his marriage to Custance. 
The Man of Law’s Tale gives a worldwide scope for Chaucer’s understanding of the presence of astrology and religion that allows us to see just how important language and religion were to English identity. This broader scope provides a vantage point to show how nationality in Chaucer’s way of defining it could have developed into something more like nationalism. Defining identity on all the things that weren’t English created an image that required exclusion of the cultures that were present to begin with. Although it was likely not a direct intent for Chaucer to generate an image in that way, it is still worth observing. I am very sure the research done in this manner is far from done. There are many more points of observation to be found in terms of scientific and religious documents becoming a real source of identity based on negatives.
Conclusions
Observing English identity alongside its development with English literature makes for fascinating observations on the role of vastly different genres of writing and how they can work together to create a cohesive picture of hierarchy. The scope of observations such as these can extend far outside of just Chaucer, although that was not the scope of this particular paper. Chaucer works as well as he does for these observations because he was both a fundamental author for English literature and a practiced writer in several different genres. In observing the role of the different types of documents he created, a picture of English development comes forward that is defined by what it is not. The consequences of defining oneself in such a way on a national scale often leads to nationalistic tendencies, especially considering said tendencies would have been present to begin with due to events such as the hundred years war and other such events. Language plays a fundamental part in something like this because a shared language provides the ability to communicate. With that comes understanding, but without it, it becomes easy to slip into issues of negative portrayal because of those differences.
