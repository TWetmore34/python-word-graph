Notes on brand statements

Be sure to add title – either fullstack dev or web dev for me I think. I for sure don’t want to use front end that’s not what im about

List of skills here – check the syllabus for all the tech you want to list , but emphasize JavaScript, CSS, React.js, node, and mysql, and a bit of python

What do you plan to work towards? Developing applications to bring joy and convenience to consumers everywhere. 

What do you bring to an employer? Attention to detail, an analytic mind, writing and communication background, and server side development

Mention enrollment in tech program, but keep it brief. Thatll be listend in the edu section anyways

Lets use first person. It’s a little more active on the verbiage, and it should let me be very explicit about what I can do

I am a server-side developer leveraging a Bachelor of Arts in English. I received my fullstack certificate from Georgia Tech, where I focused on Agile development in JavaScript, HTML5, CSS, React.js, and Node. Driven by a desire to develop apps that bring the perfect blend of joy and convenience, I love developing new products. As a result, I bring that love into everything I produce. My strengths include creativity, teamwork, and sticking with projects all the way from ideation to execution.
